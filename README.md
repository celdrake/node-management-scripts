# node-management-scripts
A simple web ui which allows users easily create nodes for https://github.com/openshift-assisted/assisted-ui-lib for testing purposes.
The intended audience are UX designers/researchers which need to be able to go over the whole flow easily but the resulting cluster is not meant to be actually used.
